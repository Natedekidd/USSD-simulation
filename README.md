# USSD-simulation
This project is a CONSOLE based USSD(Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) simulation written in python. 
It mimics the functionality of a simple banking system, allowing users to create accounts, log in, check balances, make deposits
and transfer money between accounts. 
Python was used for the application logic and sqlite was used as the database to store user information, transactions and logs.
